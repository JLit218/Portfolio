            <h4>Software Development Student</h4>
            <p>Growing up I have always found myself attracted to technology. I spent much of my childhood exploring the Internet and watched it evolve from dial-up and instant messaging to the vast sea of information it's become today.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Fast Forward to 2019: Life took me in a completely different direciton. I had just graudate with my Bachelors in Exercise Science, with some of the most prestiguous certifications in the industry. I had a job offer lined up and I had my whole life ahead of me. Only one problem. I realized that coaching was not the career for me.</p>
            <br>

            <p>The last two years have been years of self discovery. I explored who I was, and wanted to be, got to see the world a bit and met some wonderful people along the way. I found myself having success as a salesman for Angi. Although I had been incredibly thankful for the opportunity of work amongst a world-wide pandemic I still had that same problem.. This wasn't the career for me.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Spring of 2021 came along and I realized my search for a fulfilling career always pointed to one thing. Technology. After doing a bit of self-taught scripting and programing, and researching every online school and bootcamp I could, I finally came about WGU's Software Development Program. I was accepted into the program by July of 2021, and my start date was set for August first.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>I have never felt such a pull to a career. I have never enjoyed learning as much as I do now. I have realized that I've finally found the field I'm meant to be in, and the urgency to make this career change has never felt so real.</p>
            <br>
            
            <p>I will not look back. I will become a Software Engineer.</p>
